# GitHub Notes

## Creating a Repository from Local Folder

1. **Create a New Repository on GitHub:** Ensure not to initialize a README file.
2. **Navigate to the Terminal of the Folder.**
3. **Run the Following Commands:**

   _Initialize an existing directory as a Git repository_

```bash
git init
```

_Stage the current file changes for the next commit_

```bash
git add .
```

_Commit the staged changes with a meaningful message_

```bash
git commit -m "Add a descriptive message here"
```

_Link your local repository to a GitHub repository_

```bash
git remote add origin [URL]
```

_Rename the branch from master to main_

```bash
git branch -M main
```

_Push the committed changes to the GitHub repository_

```bash
git push origin main
```

**OR**

_This will make it current location so it doesn't had to be defined repetitively_

```bash
git push -u origin main
```
