# GitHub Notes

## Creating a Repository from Local Folder

1. **Create a New Repository on GitHub:** Ensure not to initialize a README file.
2. **Navigate to the Terminal of the Folder.**
3. **Run the Following Commands:**

   *Initialize an existing directory as a Git repository*   
   
```bash
git init
```
   *Stage the current file changes for the next commit*
```bash
git add .
``` 
   *Commit the staged changes with a meaningful message*

```bash
git commit -m "Add a descriptive message here"
```

   *Link your local repository to a GitHub repository*

```bash
git remote add origin [URL]
```

   *Rename the branch from master to main*
```bash
git branch -M main
```   
   *Push the committed changes to the GitHub repository*
```bash
git push origin main
```
   **OR**
   
   *This will make it current location so it doesn't had to be defined repetitively*
   
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
